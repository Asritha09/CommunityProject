                    are imparted to the child. School education provides an excellent opportunity for students to acquire knowledge 
                    in the field of literature, mathematics, science, politics, history, and numerous other important subjects. 
                    Education also plays a major role in shaping the curious minds of young children. It allows them to develop their own
                     personalities and identity.</p>
